This is my first Techdegree project!

Step 1:
Create or find an image file to represent yourself and a new image for the background. Be aware of file size: keep the profile image under 400 KB and the background image under 1 MB (see the link in the project resources section to Picresize, an online image resizing tool).

Step 2:
Feel free to expand on this project, by adding an additional page or two, adding more images and customizing the CSS.
