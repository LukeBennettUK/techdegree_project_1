        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am just starting out my journey to becoming a Web Developer. About 1 year ago I developed (no pun intended) an interest in coding. I made a lot of decisions over the past year and a lot has changed but now I am ready. I want to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript and help people realise their online dreams!</p>
        <p>I am currently a driver and work for a metal and plastics stockholder in Derby, UK. I am also an avid musician, I love to write, record and perform Guitar, Vocals and Drums. I am in the process of starting my first YouTube Channel which I am really excited for, but also quite nervous, it will be the first time I put myself out there on the internet with my own songs, singing and playing guitar. I also enjoy cycling, Snowboarding, walking and many more things. My biggest passion though is Travel. I want to travel the whole world. And hopefully coding will allow me to do this! Something I love with something I love!</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I think it is super important to have a great foundation, that is why I love Treehouse, it has some amazing courses taught by incredible teachers. I am interested in learning as much as my noggin' can take in. I love learning new things, the languages I would like to learn are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
          <li>Java</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I would love to work for small, forward thinking company, and help grow their online presence, something that I believe in, that I can help to grow, but also learn a lot and grow myself.</p>
