        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am starting out my journey to becoming a <strong>Web Developer</strong>. About 1 year ago I developed (no pun intended) an interest in coding. I made a lot of decisions over the past year and a lot has changed but now I am ready for a challenge. I will learn <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> and help people realise their <b>online dreams!</b></p>
        
        <p>I am currently a Trainee Manager and work for a metal and plastics stockholder in Derby, UK. I am also an avid musician, I love to write, record and perform Guitar, Vocals and Drums. I am in the process of starting my first <b>'YouTube Channel'</b> which I am really excited for, but also quite nervous.</p>
        
        <p>It will be the first time I put myself out there on the internet with my own songs, singing and playing guitar. I also enjoy cycling, <i>Snowboarding</i>, <i>walking</i> and many more things. My biggest passion though is <b><i>Travel</i></b>. I want to travel the whole world. And hopefully coding will allow me to do this! Something I love with something I <b>love!</b></p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>It is super important to have a great foundation, that is why I love <b>'TeamTreehouse'</b>. It has amazing courses taught by incredible teachers. 

        I am interested in learning as much as my noggin' can take in. I love learning new things, the languages I would like to learn are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
          <li>Java</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I would love to work for a modern forward-thinking company, and help to grow their online presence.
        A company that motivates and challenges me that I can help to grow, but also learn a lot and grow myself.</p>
